### Howdy there! ✌️

You spotted my personal Github profile. I am primarily a frontend developer from Germany (regional wise from Franconia) although I often try different things to get a feeling for various technologies and some may involve usage of a backend as well 🤓


### 🏆 What have I been up to?

I have recently mostly been working with Typescript, React and Node for my daily work as well as for a project in my prviate time.


### 🔥 What am I working on?
I want to learn more about different approaches to the Javascript ecosystem and try them in various minor projects to understand them on a basic level at least. Those include:
- Gatsby
- Svelte
- Vue
- Next
- and many more


### 🍻 How can you reach me?
